A JSON-defined object that describes a policy, including resource compliance requirements and the effect to take if they are violated. Learn more about the policy definition JSON structure here: Azure Policy definition structure.

A JSON-defined object that determines the resources to which a policy definition is applied. Learn more about the policy assignment JSON structure here: Azure Policy assignment structure.

Policy assignments are used by Azure Policy to define which resources are assigned which policies or initiatives. The policy assignment can determine the values of parameters for that group of resources at assignment time, making it possible to reuse policy definitions that address the same resource properties with different needs for compliance.
